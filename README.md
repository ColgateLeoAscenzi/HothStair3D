# HothStair3D
 You're a rebel scout riding a Tauntaun around the planet and you come upon an icy staircase with a height of n.

 Your Tauntaun can either climb one or two steps due to their long legs. Find how many different ways the staircase can be climbed.



This project is a visual solution to the Hoth stair climbing problem that just adds a cute animation to the answer. Instead of simply printing out the number of different ways given N stairs, a Tauntaun will climb a random path out of that set of paths, and display how many other ways it could've happened.
